# Landscape_analysis

Traditional image processing the bases for all the deep neural network algorithms that we see today for computer visions. In this repo you will see:
- Script that takes a landscape image which contains a line in the middle which seperates the intenisties.  
- The line is detected by applying thresholding using Otsu's method. It then seperates the 2 regions which are darker than each other. 
- The brightnesses are matched using simple min/max scaling and coadded to get the final result. 

Enjoy!
